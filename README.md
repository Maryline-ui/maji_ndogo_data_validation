Maji Ndogo Data Validation

This project validates and integrates agricultural, weather, and soil data from Maji Ndogo Farm Survey using SQL and Python. The analysis ensures data accuracy and consistency across multiple features, supporting insights into crop yield, farm management, and environmental conditions.

Project Overview

The goal is to validate, clean, and verify data relationships within the Maji Ndogo dataset to prepare it for accurate analysis. The project connects to a SQLite database and explores:

Geographic and environmental features

Soil and crop characteristics
Weather patterns
Farm management practices

Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy) SQLite for relational data management Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and validation SQL Queries for data integration and consistency checks

Key Tasks

Connected and queried multiple database tables using SQLAlchemy
Validated data integrity and relationships between key entities
Renamed, merged, and standardized features for clarity
Ensured clean, analysis-ready datasets

Outcome

The final validated dataset provides a reliable foundation for further agricultural productivity analysis, climate impact studies, and data-driven decision-making in farm management.
